## Q/A
1. What is the DOM?
The DOM is the document object model. It is a data stucture that helps us to render websites to the screen. We can access parts of the DOM in different ways via Javascript selectors or by referencing parent child relationships.

2. What is an event?
An event can be a number of things including clicks, scolls, hovers, or even key presses. The window is always aware of these events but does nothing with them until programmed to do so.

3. What is an event listener?
An event listener can be set up to ensure an action takes place following  specific event.

4. What is a Constructor
