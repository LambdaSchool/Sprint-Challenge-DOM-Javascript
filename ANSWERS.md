What is the DOM?
Dom stands for Document object model and the way i see it is that it is the super class of all the classes and represents everything that you see on your browser. I also kinda see it as a library with lots of functions and objects inside it. 

What is an event?
An event is an occurance happening on the screen. Anytime you click move the mouse press a key and so on. 

What is an event listener?
An event listener is used to listen for events it detects if the user has done whatever the event listener is doing and if so returns some type of data or value.

What is a Constructor
The way i understand constructors is that they help to create a template for the objects to construct from or to build from. You can pass different values to make certain key:value pairs so that the user gets the object to return them what they asked for.
