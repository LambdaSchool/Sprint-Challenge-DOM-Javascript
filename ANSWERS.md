1. The DOM is the Document Object Model, or in other words, all the HTML elements that make up the visible portion of a webpage.
2. An event an object passed by the browser to the JavaScript code when the user does any number of possible things to interact with elements on the DOM. Possible events include click, double click, scroll, mouse over, mouse enter, mouse exit, and others. The event object includes properties such as the X- and Y-pixel location of a click on a DOM node; which mouse button was clicked; whether the control, alt, or shift keys were held down; and others.
3. An event listener is an anonymous function that can be added to a DOM object such that the listener is called every time a particular type of event (such as "click") occurs on the object. The event handler can optionally receive as a parameter the event object itself, which makes it possible for the code to access its vast set of properties to obtain more information about the nature of the event and make appropriate decisions.
