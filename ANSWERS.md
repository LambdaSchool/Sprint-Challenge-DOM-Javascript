1. What is the DOM?

    The Document Object Model represents an HTML document as an Object model. It does this so that programs can change/iteract with the document structure. You can access a lot of methods and properties that come with the document object to make changes or manipulate the HTML document.

2. What is an event?

    There are many events in the DOM. We use these events to make things change when something is done. For example, the onclick event will make something happen/change when the user clicks on a element. There are many different types of events it will just depend what you want to use it for.

3. What is an event listener?

    The event listener is the function that waits for the event to trigger it. Once an event occurs, lets say you click on a element, the callback function that's inside the event listener will execute. So if the callback function is to change the background of the element that was clicked, it will do so everytime you click on it.

4. What is a Constructor?

    A constructor helps build a class or just build an object. In a class, the constructor is a method that initializes an object. So the constructor is an instance method that is used to set values. If you use a constructor outside of a class, you will be using that constructor to just make objects and set different values for each object you make.
