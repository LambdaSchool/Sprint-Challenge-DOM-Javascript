  An event is essentially a function that acts based on events that happen based on the user, such as when someone clicks a button, scrolls down a page, rolls over an object on a page, etc.

  It's the function that waits for an event from the user to occur before performing the designated operation. It "listens" to the user, for when they scroll/click etc.
