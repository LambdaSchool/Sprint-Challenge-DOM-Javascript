#What is the DOM?
The DOM stands for Document Object Model; it is a language-independent API that treats each document like a
tree, with each node representing part of that tree.

#What is an event?
An event is a signal that something has happened; every single node in the DOM can generate event signals. 
A few great examples are `click`, `mouseover`, and `keydown`.

#What is an event listener? 
An event listener is just a piece of code that executes when some event signal happens. This allows developers
to design websites that can make intelligent decisions. 

#What is a constructor? 
A constructor is a method that adds properties to the instance of the object being created.
