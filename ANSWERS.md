1. What is the DOM?
DOM is short for Document Object Model. This is a system by which executable code, such as JavaScript, is able to access and modify a webpage document. In this approach, the webpage is treated in an 0bject-oriented manner, with data being stored in a tree that terminates in a node. That node contains an object that can be accessed and modified by the code. This interface between the browser page and one's code makes it more approachable by our code.
2. What is an event?
An event is an action that occurs in the DOM. This is sometimes an action that is performed by the user--such as a click. It can also be a coded event, such as a timed action that begins or ends. 
3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is an object which gets a notification when a specified event takes place. This listener then performs a function upon finding out that the event has taken place, or triggers another function to be performed.
