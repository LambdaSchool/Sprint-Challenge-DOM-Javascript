# 1. What is the DOM?
  DOM Stands for the Document Object Model and it is a programming interface for HTML documents. The dom builds up from nodes and objects, which helps programming languages to connect to the websites. This is how we worked with Vanilla JS, when manipulated the canvases. If it would be word document, pictures, we could not do too much with the current skillset. 
  
  Each webpage is a document. And build up from objects, like <body>,<p><div> and so on.

# 2. What is an event?

  Event is any happening which happens within the DOM. It can be mouse clicks,movements, keyboard inputs, or simply that the webpage loaded, or an API sent data. 

# 3. What is an event listener?

  Event listener is a function which "pays attention" on speciefied events such as clicks, and then does something if that event happened. We attach these event listeners to objects within the DOM. 
  For example the tab that we used. When someone clicks on the tab 1 button, we removed a class and added another class for the div element. This way from display: none we went to display the current tab.
