1. The DOM(document object model is a sort of way that Javascript does stuff on a site. It goes through a hierarchy of things to be able to control specific things.(this is a terrible description)

2. An event is when something happens on the users side. It can be anything from a mouse click to a keystroke that will register itself to a function/method and respond however it is set to.

3. Much like what I had said just above, an event listener will wait for an event to happen and respond with the appropriate function.

4. Constructors are much like functions but are good for when you want to use multiple objects. Also uses "new"
