1. The DOM stands for the document object model. I believe it is what is parsed in the browser after the browser receives all of the relevant html, css, and javascript files. This parsed entity can be manipulated by various programming languages. Pragmatically, speaking, I believe in Javascript this is done using the document keyword. 

2. An event is just a action that occurs on the browser page. Events can be things like clicking, scrolling, moving the mouse, etc.

3. An event listener is code that waits and listens for events to occur. When an event listener picks up on an event that occurs, which it's assigned to, it can run code for that event.

4. A constructor is code that is run to create an instance of a class. It usually is code that makes sure that the instance has all of the essentials needed, such as assumed properties that each instance of that class is supposed to have.
