## 1. What is the DOM?

- It's stands for **D**ocument **O**bject **M**odel. It is the interface that allows us to use JavaScript to interact with HTML pages. The DOM describes the HTML document -- including every element in the page -- as objects so it can be easily referenced while writing code. This allows a developer to change and manipulate elements in a webpage!

## 2. What is an event?

- An event is an action that happens in the DOM. An event can be triggered by user pressing a keyboard key or clicking a mouse button or it can be triggered by another action happening like a video being started or finished.

## 3. What is an event listener?

- An event listener "listens" for certain actions happening and reports it back when that specific action (or event) happens.
