1. What is the DOM?
DOM is the abbreviation of Document Object Model. A web page is a document, this document is written in HTML, and could be displayed in browser. DOM represents the same document as nodes and objects, thus web pages could be modified by scripting language such as JavaScript throught DOM. Everytime using JavaScript to update HTML document, not only the part that should be manipulated, the whold DOM would be reloaded, this will slow down the processing, and makes DOM an inefficient way to modify web pages.


2. What is an event?
3. What is an event listener?
Something happens in the system when you are programming, this thing is called Event. And the responce that is fired by the event, is called event-listener. For example, when you click a 'button', the bulb will be turned on. The action that you click the button, is called an Event. The bulb image on the web page changes from 'crystal-off-bulb' to a 'yellow-light-on-bulb' image, this occurrence is called event listener. There is a function code to make this whole change happen, and this function is called event handler.
