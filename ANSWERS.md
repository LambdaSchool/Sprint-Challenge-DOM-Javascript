# Vanilla DOM Manipulation Sprint
## What is the DOM?
- **DOM** stands for **Document Object Model**, and at its simplest, it is a tree structure consisting of nodes and objects which represent a webpage, allowing it to be manipulated with other programming languages, such as JavaScript.

## What is an event?
- An interface which represents any event taking place in the DOM, such as mouse clicks or key presses, as well as media elements such as animations starting or ending, sounds being played, and so on.

## What is an event listener?
- Basically, an object which is listening for an event, such as a button which, when clicked, will trigger some script elements which manipulate the DOM in some way. They can be attached to most objects within a document, or the whole document itself.
