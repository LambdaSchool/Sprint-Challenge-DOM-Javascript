What is the DOM? - The DOM interprets HTML documents in such a way as to make it accessible for a coding language (most languages need objects in order to do things, the DOM interprets all HTML parts as objects)
[basically, an API for making HTML interact with code]

What is an event? - an event is an alert(of sorts) sent by the DOM to a piece of code, saying that something has happened (a click, for example);

What is an event listener? - an event listener is an ambassador for an event, activating when the event happens and executing whatever code it is told to execute
