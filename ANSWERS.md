The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent application programming interface that treats an HTML, XHTML, or XML document as a tree structure.

An event is something you do on the web page, like moving your mouse around, scrolling, or clicking a link.

An event listener is a procedure or function in a computer program that waits for an event to occur; that event may be a user clicking or moving the mouse, pressing a key on the keyboard.

A constructor is basically a function that is used to set the properties and methods of an Object.
