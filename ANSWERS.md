1. The DOM short for Document Object Model, it is the panel in the DevTools that you are using that shows you stuff that looks like HTML but its a visual representation of the DOM. It represents the document as nodes and objects. With different programming languages being used it will be a way to connect to the DOM because it is data structure like of like a tree. 
2. An event in DOM is used to notify that something is happening in the code. Events are the actions that need to happen, like clicking. Each event that is created is represented by an object. The event may have additional custom fields and/or functions used to get additional information about what happened. 
3.  An event listener are elements that are used to help manage how that element reacts to events. The elements can interact or not interact depending on what you enter, for example links or buttons. An event listener is added so the program can give back information when a user clicks a button. 
4. A constructor is a special method that creates and sets the value or puts in the condition appropriate to the start of an operation of an object created within a class.
