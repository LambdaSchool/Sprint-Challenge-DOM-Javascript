1. DOM stands for Document Object Model which is a graphical representation of the content,structure and style of a webpage.  It breaks the page down into a tree structure with the DOM as the root and its nodes (and child nodes) beneath it.  This allows us to use javascript to access these nodes to manipulate them.

2. An event is any action that the end user does to act on the webpage.

3. An event listener is a function/method that is created on an element that will be acted upon when the event occurs

4. A constructor is a function used to create objects.  It is basically a template used for object creation that will have the same attributes.
