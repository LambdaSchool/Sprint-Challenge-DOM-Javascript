1. The DOM is what we use to connect different progamming languages to web pages. It gives us a useable object that we can manipulate with javascript in order to interact with the page. The DOM is a tree data structure containing all of the data within different nodes that we can perform operations on. We use this to attach event listeners to a webpage that then respond given a certain input from the user.

2. An event is an interaction with the webpage that we can register and then perform a given output. An event can be the click of the mouse or using the scrollwheel, but it is typically generated by the user. Events propagate up the tree from children to parents unless strictly told otherwise.

3. An event listener is a function that recieves a given event and then performs a given operation and returns an output of some type. This function can be attached to the DOM element itself or somewhere further down the data tree and listens for the specified event to occur.
