#1. What is the DOM?

##DOM is short for Document Object Manipulation. It, in essense, is the integration of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create manipulable and interactive web pages. The DOM operates in such a way that when a webpage is opened it first reads the HTML for the site layout, but then overlays that layout with a JavaScript Object so that the site now has interactive elements. Similar to CSS, the DOM structure is a tree and therefore there are many inheritance, or event propagation rules, that we must follow to make sure each element on the page interacts in accordance with the stipulations we've placed on the code.

#2. What is an event?

## An event is any kind of interaction that occurs with a webpage on the user end, such as a click, cursor movement, scrolling, keyboard use. When an event culminates it is now considered triggered.

#3. What is an event listener?

## An event listener is a line of JS code that allows us to register when an event has taken place. They are placed on objects and give that object a callback function so that when the event is triggered, the callback runs.
