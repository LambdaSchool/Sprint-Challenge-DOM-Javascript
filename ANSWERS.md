1. The DOM is the Document Object Model. It is a paradigm and programming interface that allows the programmer to interact with HTML elements in their code. 

2. An event is essentially a trigger that is fired by the actions of the user, browser, or possibly other entity. When an event occurs on a page, the browser will use DOM rules to visit the appropriate nodes and inform them of the event.

3. An event listener is a function that has been assigned to a DOM element, and is called when the event being "listened" for has fired. They are arbitrary blocks of code that can execute any code, and have access to the details of the event.

4. A constructor is a syntactical convenience which overlays the prototypical inheritance underpinning javascript. Inside a constructor function is performed the work for instantiating a new instance of an object.
