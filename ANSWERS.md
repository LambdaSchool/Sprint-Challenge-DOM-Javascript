### 1. What is the DOM?
It is a way of organizing documents in a tree structure where each part is a node that represents an object on the page (like a paragraph or link). This lets you modify the properties of the page through code.

### 2. What is an event?
An event is a user interaction with the page. It could be a click, a scroll, click and drag, or many other methods of manipulating a web page.

### 3. What is an event listener?
An object which runs a particular callback function (aka something that runs after everything else) that is executed once an event occurs. A listener might, for example, be waiting for a user to click on a button before executing a function which swaps the image of the button.

### 4. What is a Constructor?
A Constructor is a standardized way of creating objects with the properties that you want, using a function. It is analogous to an assembly line that mass produces bikes with the same specifications.
