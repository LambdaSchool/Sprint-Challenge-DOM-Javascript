## Questions

1. What is the DOM?
*  The DOM is the acronym for the Document Object Model. The DOM is the representation of the HTML (OR XHTML or XML) document as a tree data structure, with children branching from parents. Each node represents an element of the DOM. A programming language, JavaScript in our case, is used to interface with and manipulate the DOM, rendering the results users see in the browser on web pages and in web apps. 

2. What is an event?
*  An event is some instance that occurs, often via user input (or otherwise, the browser), such as a click, scroll, etc,. These events can be recognized in JavaScript and used to invoke a callback function on the occurence of the event. They are key to many changes in the DOM. 

2. What is an event listener?
*  An event listener is code in JavaScript that "listens" for these events described above to occur, and which take a prescribed action via callback function, when this happens.
