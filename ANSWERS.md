**Q1** What is the DOM?

The DOM is an acronym for the Document Object Model. We use the DOM when we interact with webpages. We can use the DOM to add content to an HTML document, remove content from it and/or modify content from it. All this can be done on the fly as the web page is being viewed in the web browser.

**Q2** What is an event?

HTML DOM events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are working with or programming. 

**Q3** What is an event listener? 

An event listener lets the system know when an event occurs. An action then automatically occurs. So it waits for an event to occur such as a click and it then reacts to that input with a function or procedure of sorts. This function is not executed until the event occurs. So when a user clicks a button, the event handler, onclick, could execute the action when the event occurs on the designated element.
