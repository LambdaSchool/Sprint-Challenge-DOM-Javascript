## Questions

    * Document Object Model: Is a Data Structure containing all the elements in a browser page in a Tree-like structure, where everything is contained inside the document or root node, and all other elements are contained inside, and each element may have other elements inside, and so on.
2. What is an event?
    * An event is an interaction with the dom or one of it's elements, it can be something like a click over an element, loading the document, changing the browser's dimension, and they are triggered upon user interaction usually. Events can be used to implement functionality in web applications.
2. What is an event listener?
    * An event listener is a function that waits for events to be triggered, like a spider waiting in the web for a bug to touch it, when the bug touches the web, it moves it, and the spider knows a bug is caught. The same way the listeners wait for events to be triggered to perform some sort of function specified to them.
