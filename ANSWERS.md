**Vanilla JS DOM Manipulation Fu**

1. What is the DOM?

The Document Object Model is an application programming interface used to targetelements (or objects) on a document and manipulate them through different programming languages. JavaScript is often used in the DOM.

2. What is an event?

An event in the DOM is any action (that is usually labeled  in the DOM) while targeting objects on the document. Examples can be clicking, hovering the arrow icon, or scrolling down past an element. Labeled events are 'onclick', 'mouseover', etc.

3. What is an event listener?

An event listener attaches the event to the event handler, helping the handler  operate any method or  function needed done on the object.
