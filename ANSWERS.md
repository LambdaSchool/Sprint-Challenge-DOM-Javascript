1. What is the DOM?
* The `DOM` is the document object model. It is a cross-platform, language-independent application programming interface that treats `HTML`, `XHTML` or `XML` document as a tree structure. Which means that each `node`is an `object` that represents parts of the document. The `object` can be manipulated programmatically and any visible changes occuring as a result may then be reflected in the display of the document.

*An example of this would be an `HTML` `document` model. Transversing down the `tree` from `Document` to '<!DOCTYPE html>` and so on and so forth.

2. What is an event?
* An `event` is an action or occurence that happens in the system that you are programming which tells you about so you can respond to them in some way if desired.

*An example of this is when some clicks on the button in webpage and some kind of information form comes up.

2. What is an event listener?

* An `event listener` is a procedure or `function` in a computer program that waits for an event to occur; that event may be a user clicking or moving the mouse, pressing a key on the keyboard, or an internal timer or interrupt. The listener is in effect a `loop` that is programmed to react to an input or signal.
