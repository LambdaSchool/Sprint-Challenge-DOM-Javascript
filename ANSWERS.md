1. DOM is short for document object model, a tree that starts with the document and then branches down to the various consecutive elements that make up the tree. It specifically outlines the way the document can be accessed and manipulated, in our case, using ES.

2. Events are dynamic scripts added to the HTML that react to specific the specific stimuli they were programmed to.

3. An event listener (I also believe they can be referred to as event handles) is a program giving a certain condition to look out for and when that condition is met (click, page load, mouse hover, etc.) it activates an event.

4. A constructor is a function that takes in object properties and can create new objects using them. new Object(), new String(), etc. The properties are passed in as parameters and are used to represent the object's property values.
