1.  DOM is an api for documents that represent them in a tree structure. This
    makes is possible to access and manipulate the HTML Document using JS

2.  The first event to occur is the page itself being loaded. From that moment, 
    mouse click/movement, key press, etc all create an event that can be used to trigger a response (in our case with JS code).

3.  An eventListener is like giving the intended html target ears. It allows it   
    to hear any events triggered by the user, and if any are directed at itself,
    see if it has been given a method to respond with.

4.  Used in object oriented programming, it is used by Classes to all the
    initialization of objects of a specific type (class) with default values or
    ones that are specified by the user.
