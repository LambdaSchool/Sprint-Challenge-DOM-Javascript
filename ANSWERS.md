 Questions
 1.  What is the DOM? 

 DOM is document Object Model, it is an API (application programming interface) for HTML documents. These HTML documents are treated as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document thus it is object-oriented. The DOM can be modified by multiple scripting languages. 
 
 2. What is an event? 

 An event is an action or occurrence recognized by software, such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or messages from other programs/threads. DOM events allow event-driven programming languages like JavaScript register various event handlers or listeners on the element nodes inside a DOM tree, such as in HTML documents.

3. What is an event listener? 

An event listener is a procedure or function in a program that waits for an event to occur; that event may be a user clicking or moving the mouse, pressing a key on the keyboard, or an internal timer or interrupt. The listener is in effect a loop that is programmed to react to an input or signal.
