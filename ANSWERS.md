1. What is the DOM?

    The Document Object Model. The DOM is the object representation of the webpage's elements and allows programmers to manipulate those objects. This can both improve user experience and improve things on the programming side.

2. What is an event?

    An event on the webpage is connected to some input device acting on the webpage. A mouse and keyboard are the most common devices that initiate events. When we click a 'submit' button on a webpage with our mouse, that generates a 'click' event.
3. What is an event listener?

    An event listener reacts to an event. Without an event listener, basically a plan of what to do in the case of '___' event, nothing would happen. An example scenario of the relationship between an event and an event listener is a Girl Scout knocking on your door. The event in this case is the Girl Scout knocking on the door. The event listener is your reaction to hearing the knock on the door and then carrying out what you plan to do about it.

4. What is a Constructor

    A constructor is a special class with the objective of creating multiple similar objects in the same way some factory manufactures your favorite nerd gear. When the constructor is called to make a new object of its class, inside itself are the blueprints to creating everything that object will need. A constructor allows a programmer to reuse code to easily create new objects.
