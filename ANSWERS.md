1. The DOM is the end result of your HTML interfacing with Javascript.
2. An event can be anything that happens on the page, mostly through user input.
3. An event listener listens for these inputs so that your code can then take action based on them.
4. A constructor is the part of a class that builds it up from parameters that are passed in (or not based on parameters        at times when using defaults)
