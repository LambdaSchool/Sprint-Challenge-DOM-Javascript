1. What is the DOM?
Dom stands for Document Object Model. I was and am still not extremely secure in my understanding but my understanding is that while it can appear to look like the HTML code that we write, it is not exactly that. The panel we use to look at the code in the browser is the DOM. It looks like HTML but it differs in some ways. One difference is that Javascript can manipulate it. 
2. What is an event?
An event is an action or occurence that triggers another reaction. Some examples could be a button press or click that sets off another event. 
3. What is an event listener?
An event listener waits for the event to happen so that it can set off the rest of what is supposed to occur in the program. 
4. What is a Constructor?
A constructor is a way to create a new object "type"  that can be used multiple times and doesn't need to be redefined. It is like the blueprint.
