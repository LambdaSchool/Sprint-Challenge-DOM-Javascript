### 1. What is the DOM?

 - The DOM or Document Object Model is created when the web page is loaded. It is represented as a tree of Objects composed of HTML elements which can be manipulated through Javascript by changing, adding, and deleting elements on the page.

### 2. What is an event?

- An event is an action that happens on the web page such as someone clicking a certain element, hovering their mouse over a certain item and many more. Javascript is used to run code when the event happens such as onclick. 

### 3. What is an event listener?

- Usually a function that waits for an event to happen like clicking on a certain element. For example someone may have a function like
```
document.addEventListener('click', aFunction);
```
- which would run a function when the document is clicked on. In other words the function is 'listening' for a click before it runs the event in the function.
