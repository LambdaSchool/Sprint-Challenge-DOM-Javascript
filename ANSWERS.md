DOM stands for Document Object Model. It uses your HTML to create Node Trees so that you can access your data and manipulate it. 
An Event is something that happens that triggers a function to be implemented (like clicking a button will trigger a function to start).
An Event Listener is how the developer tells the Javascript what Event to look for in each specific element. 
A constructor is basically a template for creating new objects.
