## Questions
1. What is the DOM?
Well the DOM is like a wrapper that is used for your site, it makes it so you can use JavaScript to more easily affect everything you are coding, such as interacting with your CSS and HTML to accomplish more dynamic and interactive things. It is also a very important concept to master and has it's own rules and documentation. It is the backbone of making truly amazing sites.

2. What is an event?
To be able to accomplish things dynamically on a site, events are important. You code them in, decide what purpose they have, and what will occur once they are triggered, then add in an event listener to be able to use the event. They can accomplish a wide range of tasks and using JS many interesting additions can be added to your basic CSS/HTML site. Making it less static and more modern as well.

3. What is an event listener?
An event listener is how events are able to know when and how to be used. They check for certain changes or things that happen, and then execute the code that was written based on what occurred. An example would be using one to find out if the user moved their mouse into a certain square on your site, then have the event trigger, which turns the square a different color and displays a message. Event listeners are what help you to be able to use events.

4. What is a Constructor
The special thing about constructors is that they allow creating classes and using objects in a unique way. You are able to create and initialize an object that was created in a class. It's a form of closure that allows code to be used even if not in the same code block and is useful for classes in particular. Not always needed but very useful and powerful.
