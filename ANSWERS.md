# Sprint Challenge #3: DOM-JavaScript 

## Self Study Questions:

1. What is the DOM?
    *  `DOM` is an acronym for "Direct Object Model".  Everything that is typed inside of the index.HTML file (along with any JavaScript or CSS imports), is interpretted into a web-page.  The web-page itself is more specifically now "on the DOM" - an object tree added to the Document Object Model.

2. What is an event?
    * An `event`, while in the context of this week's assignments, might be defined as any physical action (like the click of a mouse or the press of a key).

3. What is an event listener?
    * An event listener is a function that waits and listens for a specific type of even in a specific location on the DOM.  This is not unlike a conditional statement which only executes under specific conditions.  For example the conditional statment "if(x === 0) return "Times Up", only runs under the specific condition -- when x === 0.  Similarly, event listeners will run only when a specific event (e.g. the click of mouse) is made in a specific location (e.g. the element with class "Button").
4. What is a Constructor?
    * A constructor is a part of a class which is typically used to set the stage of instances created from that
    class.  Initial values and importing of elements that will be needed to run any methods existing on the class
    will be found in the constructor.  The term "Constructor" is also sometimes used synonomously with ES2015 "classes".
