* The Document Object Model is the rendering of HTML, CSS, and JS of a page in a web browser.  It is a tree structure, where each node is an object on the page.  It allows us to refer to object siblings, parents, and children which in turn allows referetial interactivity with the code (i.e. event listeners).

2. What is an event?
* An event is generally a user activity (mouse click, scroll, mouse away, etc.).  It can also be anything the browser does, such as a page loading.  More specifically, it is anything that triggers feedback from the system.

3. What is an event listener?
* Code that handles, or responds to an event is called an event listener.  They program something to happen (text appearing, disappearing, etc.) a specific event is triggered in the system (click, scroll, page load, etc.).

4. What is a Constructor
* The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created within a class.  It comes at the beginning of a class and is automatically trigerred when the new keyword is used and a specific class object is instantiated.
