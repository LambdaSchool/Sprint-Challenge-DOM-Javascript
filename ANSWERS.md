## Questions
1. What is the DOM?
- (DOM) stands for document object model and is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.
2. What is an event?
- Event interface represents any event which takes place in the DOM; some are user-generated (such as mouse or keyboard events), while others are generated by APIs (such as events that indicate an animation has finished running, a video has been paused, and so forth). There are many types of events, some of which use other interfaces based on the main Event interface. Event itself contains the properties and methods which are common to all events.
2. What is an event listener?
- EventListener interface represents an object that can handle an event dispatched by an EventTarget object.
