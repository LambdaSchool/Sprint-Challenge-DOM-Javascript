1. What is the DOM?
The DOM is the Document Object Model.
It's an object.
It's made from HTML that I write that is parsed in the browser.

2. What is an event?
When something happend to an HTML element.
An opportunity to JS to be executed when the event happens.

3. What is an event listener?
JS code that 'listens' or looks for an event to happen so that code can be executed

ex. an HTML button is clicked, the listener detects the click and code is executed that changes the color of the button or makes something else happen such as a alert.

4. What is a Constructor
A way to create object of the same type. Kind of like a blueprint.
