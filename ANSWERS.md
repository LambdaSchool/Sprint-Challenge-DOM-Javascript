#What is the DOM?
The DOM stands for document object model and is a language-independent application programming interface that 
treats each document like a tree, with each node representing a part of that tree.

#What is an event?
An event is just a signal that something has happened. Every node within the DOM is capable of generating event
signals. A few good examples of events are `click`, `mouseover`, and `keydown`. 

#What is an event listener?
Developers can take advantage of event signals by adding event listeners to their programs. A specific piece of
code can be executed when an event happens. This allows developers to design websites capable of making 
intelligent decisions.
