1.  The DOM is the Document Object Model. It defines each node in browser memory and gives defaults depending on current browser engine.

2.  An event is an interface to handle certain aspects of a DOM node's lifecycle. For example, every item can be clicked if it is displayed so every item can handle an `onclick` event.

3.  An event listener is the other half of the event-listener paradigm. The event listener is a function that is run everytime a particular event is called.

4.  A constructor is a function that is called by the item being generated within that instantiated object's declaration and usually defines defaults.
