1. The DOM is the document object model. It is a programming interface used for HTML documents.
2. An event is something that happens, either induced by the user or the site itself.
3. An event listener "listens" for the when to have an event begin. There are different
   types of listeners, such as mousedown, mouseup, click, etc.
4. A constructor is similar to a mold. When a new object is made using the constructor,
   there are presets, such as properties and methods, that each new object will be created with.
