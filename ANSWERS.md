### 1. What is the DOM?
* The DOM connects a web page to a programming language. The DOM represents the web page as tree. Through DOM methods the tree or web page can then be manipulated.

### 2. What is an event?
* An event occurs within the DOM. Many events are user-driven like clicking on a link or filling out a form. Other events are tied to APIs and can be related to playing a video or animation.

### 3. What is an event listener?
* An event listener is a method that is called on a 'target' which could be a DOM element, or any other object that supports events. When the event occurs on the target, a function is called.
