1. DOM is the "Document Object Model". It's an organization model, which 
has the document at the top, and all its elements are the children of
document. Document would be the first level, HTML would be the second level (child of document), <head> and <body> share the third level (child[0] and child[1], respectively, of <html>), and so on. If the elements are siblings, than they're at the same level (<head> and <body> are siblings, both level three); so the children are one level below the parent, siblings are the same level, etcetera. There are many ways to specify which element to use, such as document.child[0].child[1] (to get <body>, this is the long way), document.getElementByTagName("body") (there are many methds like this).

2. 3. There are many events that can be traced on elements because all elements on an html can be selected in the DOM. Once the elements are selected in the DOM, javascript can manipulate the element in many different ways, such as changing styles, adding attributes, removing attributes, displaying elements, hiding elements, adding dropdown menus, allowing input of data (such as forms) and performing an action on that data, there are so many uses. First, the element is chosen (with any method, such as querySelector) , than the element chosen is added and "event listener" that will listen for the specified event, such as clicking on that element selected (or toggle, mouseover, mouseleave, or any other event listener). The Event listener than performs an action specified, such as alerting the user who clicked on an element (such as a button).

4. A constructor is part of a class, and the properties on the constructor are inherited by each instance of the class. So, if I want to create an instance of the class, with its properties, I would do something like let newInstance = new ClassName("key value 1", "key value 2"). newInstance will have all properties of the class, with the values of the properties set on the creation of newInstance. newInstance is an object that inherited the properties of the class constructor, and the values of every object are unique, as each new object has to specify the value for each property on the constructor (unless the constructor has a fixed value to a property).
