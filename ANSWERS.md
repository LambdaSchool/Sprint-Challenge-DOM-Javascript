## Questions
1. What is the DOM?
+ DOM stands for Document Object Model. How I understand it on a surface level is that it is the interpreter and fixer for HTML and Javascript. For HTML, the DOM can often feel in the blanks as it were to make sure the HTML is executed properly by the browser. Similarly, Javascript is simply a language that the browser can read, but the DOM us where the stuff actually happens. The DOM is emitting the behavior and it's where everything happens in the browser.

2. What is an event?
+ An event is simply a behavior emitted when a certain javascript program is called when, say, a user clicks on an HTML element. Basically, it sets the stage for you to be able to respond to certain actions committed by your users.

3. What is an event listener?
+ The event listener is basically a method attached to a specific element to watch for when behaviors that you want to capture from your user are emitted.
