1. What is the DOM? -
DOM stands for Document Object Model which is API that Javascript will interact with the HTML elements through nodes and objects.
2. An event is a trigger on the html that will cause an action to happen in the Javascript. examples - click, scroll, mouseover, onchange, mouseleave, mouseout.
3. event listeners are the part of Javascript that will actually cause a change to be made from the event. example- element.addEventListener('click', () => {
  alert('Hello');
  })
will pop open a dialog box with hello in it.
