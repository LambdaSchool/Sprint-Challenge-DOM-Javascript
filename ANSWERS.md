1. The DOM is the "Document Object Manager."  It is the object that is built with the HTML, styled by the CSS, and interacted with by JavaScript.
2. An event is how the user interacts with the DOM.  Clicking, hovering, scrolling, etc...
3. An event listener waits for a specified event to interact with it's HTML item (click on a button), then runs a function (go to the link).
4. A constructor builds the object as per prewritten parameters.
