1. DOM is Document Object Model that allows us to access a document and update it by accessing the parent node and child elements and manipulating them. 
2. An event is any event handler that occurs on the DOM such as pausing a video or using a mouse.
3. An event listener uses an event handler to an element such as clicking on an element of the object.
4. A constructor is a class that can be used to reused to make an event listener be applied to many elements at once from that specific class.
