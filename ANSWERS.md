1: it is the Document Object Model; and it alows you better control over selecting classes, i think so you can grab the classes directly in your javascript, DOM is kind of a bridge between the html and the backend of the code, i think?

2: and event is something that is triggered on the page, such as click, mouseup, scroll, ect. that is considered an event.

3: an event listener, listens for one of the above events and when it happens allows you to excute a function.

4: A constructor is something that is used to construct objects, we mainly use it with a class it takes in values when you call it and assigns inside of it's variables.
this.element and so on.
